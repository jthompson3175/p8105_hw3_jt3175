Load the data:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of
observations.

``` r
# Look at a random person's order info for an illustrative example
set.seed(5)
instacart_sample = instacart %>% 
  filter(user_id == sample(pull(instacart, user_id), 1)) 
```

The instacart dataset contains detailed information from online grocery
orders from 2017. It contains 1384617 observations and 15 variables. The
dataset is organized by order. Within each order, there is one row for
each item purchased, and these items have an ID and description given by
*product\_id* and *product\_name*. Each customer and order have a unique
ID, represented by the variables *user\_id* and *order\_id*. The dataset
also contai ns IDs and names for each aisle and department from which
every item came. There are 131209 distinct orders, made by 131209
different customers. Therefore, this dataset contains one order per
customer. There is not a case of the same customer havind multiple
orders here.

For example, we can look at the order for the customer with *user\_id*
77951. That customer ordered 7 items, including “Ancient Grain Original
Granola.” Customer 77951 had ordered 6 of the 7 items previously.
